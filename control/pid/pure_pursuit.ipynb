    "<U>Pure-pursuit Control</U> is a path tracking algorithm that makes the robot to follow a given trajectory. It simply computes the angular velocity command that moves the robot from its current position to reach some look-ahead point on the given trajectory. The robot then moves the nearest look-ahead point on the path based on the current position of the robot until the last point of the path. \n",
